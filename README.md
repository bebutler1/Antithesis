# Antithesis
A Matchup Logging Tool for League of Legends Players

# What’s this thing do? Who’s it for? 
Antithesis is a matchups logging tool for League of Legends players. Simply put, if you’re someone who likes to keep track of your lane matchups, and make notes about them, Antithesis will allow you to do that. “So it’s just Notepad”...yes, but better, or at least more suited towards League of Legends. Whereas with Notepad you’d have to Ctrl+F to find a matchup, or save specific matchups in separate files Antithesis allows you to quickly save and retrieve specific matchups with relatively more ease and speed. Simply use the appropriate search option (see section 2), and you’ll be on your way. If you want to use Notepad, that’s great too...just pick your own fancy. Of course everyone’s not necessarily interested in logging about their matchups, and that’s okay, but if you are interested, consider giving Antithesis a try.  

# Three Types of Searches?! 
Yes, there are three kinds of searches, and each is directed towards specific inputs and returns. Let’s go over each in some detail. 

## Type 1- Nemesis Search
Nemesis search allows users to quickly find out their best matchup against an enemy champion. Simply enter the enemy Champion’s name, and Antithesis will return up to two options for you to choose from based on the data within the collection. The returned champion(s) will have the highest win rates against the enemy that you entered. Bear in mind that the returns are entirely dependent on the data that you’ve saved into the collection, so be sure to be active and use Antithesis after each match. Additionally, any notes that you’ve made for the matchup will also be returned back to you.

## Type 2- Collection Search
Collection Search allows users to readily retrieve all of their match stats for the champion they enter. Antithesis stores all user entries to a centralized, local, collection and retrieves data out of it. For example, let’s say you want to see all of your matchups stats for Bard: simply enter Bard and press the  Collection Search button, and Antithesis will return a list of all of your matchup stats for Bard. Notes aren’t included in Collection Search’s feedback.  

## Type 3- Advanced Search
Advanced Search allows users to retrieve a specific matchup’s data. For this type of search you’ll need to enter the champion and it’s lane opponent into the search bar, and each name will need to be separated by a comma. For example inputs should look like ‘Bard,Thresh’. You can think of Advanced Search like a specified combination of Nemesis and Collection Search. Like Nemesis Search, Advanced Search returns matchup stats and notes, and like Collection Search it targets specified champions rather than analyzing the entire collection of data. 


Each kind of search emulates use cases for Notepad or Sticky Notes like looking at notes, or finding specific champion information, and seeks to make doing it a little easier, or at the very least faster. 


You can Log Your Data…
Yep, simply visit the ‘Make an Entry’ page, and follow the form to enter your data. 

## Installation
Installation is pretty simple, just download the latest release, extract the files from the zip, and run the Install.exe file. It will take care of the rest. Install.exe is programmed to run all of the necessary operations.
I hope you all enjoy.

## About Updates...
Updates will occur in tandem with new champion releases for League of Legends. I predict ~5 updates every ranked season, but I will keep users updated on my discord server: https://discord.gg/4t8SGh .
